 - Shade the area between the record highs and lows for better visualization.
2. Identifying 2015 Extremes:
 - Scatter plot any 2015 temperatures (highs or lows) that exceed the 2005–2014 records.
3. Leap Year Handling:
 - Exclude February 29th from the dataset for consistency across non-leap years.
